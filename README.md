# Boilerplate-express-react

This is an starter package with express and React connected, and ready to use.

Hot to use it:

```
git clone https://github.com/coderHook/boilerplate-express-react
```

Once we have clone this is the structure of our APP:

Boilerplate-express-react
  - Client (Has its own package.json)
  - package.json
  - server.js

Now lets install the dependencies of our server and Client.

In our toot folder /Boilerplate-express-react
```
npm install
```

Check if its needed to isntall it also in the client folder boilerplate-express.react/client and type npm install again.

After this we have everythin ready. Now we have to put up the server and de development client.

1) Open a terminal in our root folder boilerplate-express.react and type:
```
npm run start
```
(It will initialize the server)

2) Open a terminal in our Client folder boilerplate-express.react/client and type:
```
npm run start
```

now we should see at the bottom of the fie the following text:

`YOUR EXPRESS BACKEND IS CONNECTED TO REACT`

It means that everything went well and now we have an express server ready to use with react.
